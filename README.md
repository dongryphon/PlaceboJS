# PlaceboJS

-- "Making other packages better since 2014"

# Version 2

After an amazine two year run, version 2 is ready! A complete rewrite
and yet highly compatible and performant. Now with exhaustive unit
tests (no code escaped test coverage!) and npm availability by popular
demand.

Version 2 has some amazing benefits:

 - Blazing performance! No library is faster! Period.
 - Minimal footprint! No library is smaller!
 - Minimal learning curve!
 - Beta testers report that version 2 is twice as benefial to their apps!

## Upgrades

Unlike other libraries that break the world moving from 1.0 to 2.0, I am
delighted to announce:

** PlaceboJS version 2 has zero (0) breaking changes! **

Put that in your Angular pipe and smoke it!
